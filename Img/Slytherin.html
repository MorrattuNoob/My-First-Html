<b>
<center><h1>Slytherin</h1>
Slytherin house has an unfortunate reputation. While it is true that a lot of dark witches and wizards were sorted into Slytherin, not all who belong to this house are bad. In fact, there are a lot of excellent qualities the Sorting Hat looks for in potential Slytherins and Merlin himself even belonged to this misunderstood house!<br><br>

The house colours for Slytherin are silver and emerald green and the emblem is a serpent. The Head of House is Professor Severus Snape, and the common room can be found down in the dungeons under the lake (which only adds to the Slytherin air of mystery).<br><br>

If the Sorting Hat placed you in this noble house, then you are most likely ambitious, shrewd and possibly destined for greatness. We can imagine you’re the kind of person who is always one step ahead, has a dark sense of humour, thinks reputation is important, takes pride in their appearance and doesn’t let anyone see their soft side.<br><br>
